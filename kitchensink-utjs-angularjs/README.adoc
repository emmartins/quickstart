[abstract]
Based on kitchensink, but uses a Angular for the front end and Undertow.js for the back end.

== What is it?

This quickstart is a deployable Maven 3 project to help you get your foot in the door developing with Undertow.js and {javaVersion} on JBoss WildFly.

This project is setup to allow you to create a compliant {javaVersion} application using Undertow.js CDI 1.1, JPA 2.1 and Bean Validation 1.1. It includes a persistence unit and some sample persistence and transaction code to introduce you to database access in Undertow.js.

== System requirements

All you need to build this project is ${build.requirements}. See https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN_JBOSS_EAP7.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts[Configure Maven for ${productName} ${product.version}] to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.

== Start JBoss WildFly with the Web Profile

. Open a command line and navigate to the root of the JBoss server directory.
.

The following shows the command line to start the server with the web profile:

[source]
----
For Linux:   JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
For Windows: JBOSS_HOME\bin\standalone.bat
----

== Build and Deploy the Quickstart

_NOTE: The following build command assumes you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts#build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts[Build and Deploy the Quickstarts] for complete instructions and additional options._

. Make sure you have started the JBoss Server as described above.
. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
.

Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

[source]
----
mvn clean package wildfly:deploy
----

.

This will deploy `target/${project.artifactId}.war` to the running instance of the server.

Access the application
———————

The application will be running at the following URL: http://localhost:8080/${project.artifactId}/[http://localhost:8080/${project.artifactId}/].

== Undeploy the Archive

. Make sure you have started the JBoss Server as described above.
. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
.

When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:

[source]
----
mvn wildfly:undeploy
----

== Run the Quickstart in JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For more information, see https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_JBDS.md[Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts]

== Debug the Application

If you want to debug the source code or look at the Javadocs of any library in the project, run either of the following commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect them.

mvn dependency:sources
mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc
